Singleton Pattern (Creational).

Involves a single class which is responsible for creating an object while making sure that only one object exists. This class provides a way to access it's only object which can be accessed directly without needing to instantiate an object of the class.

* Create a Singleton Class.
  * `SingleObject.java`
* Get the only object from the singleton class.
  * `SingletonPatternDemo.java`
* Verify the output.
```
Hello World!
```
